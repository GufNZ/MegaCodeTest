# Mega Code Test

- Minified the .png files via tinypng.com
- Got the UI into a reasonable state, and wired up some logic for the form and got the list rendering from a template + data.
- Ran out of time before I implemented the upload functionality or the crypto, but I had it planned out as to how it would work.
	- I had researched how to get at the file contents and process them, and hooking up the crypto stuff would have been easy, starting with the examples in the instructions.
	- jQuery's ajax stuff was my plan for sending the data.
- I didn't get to the server-side either, tho I had that sketched out in my head.  I hadn't fully decided on the auth mechanisms yet.
